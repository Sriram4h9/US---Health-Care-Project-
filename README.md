Case Study: US Healthcare Data Analysis
Objective:
The aim of this project is to analyze hospital data from 100 US healthcare institutions, focusing on patient demographics, admission types, and insurance information. The objective is to derive actionable insights that address the key questions posed by healthcare executives.

Problem Statement:
Analyzing the Impact of Demographics and Admission Types on Healthcare Costs and Outcomes
This study aims to uncover the relationships between demographic factors (age, gender, income, etc.) and patient outcomes, focusing on healthcare costs, medical conditions, and admission types.

Key Aspects of the Analysis:
Prevalent Medical Conditions by Demographics:

Goal: Identify which medical conditions are most common within specific demographic groups (age, gender, income level, etc.).
Methodology: Used data segmentation and filtering techniques to categorize patients based on demographics and identify trends in their medical conditions.
Healthcare Costs by Admission Type:

Objective: Examine how different types of admissions (emergency, elective, urgent) impact healthcare costs.
Approach: Analyzed the cost per admission type and correlated with patient outcomes for insights on cost efficiency and effectiveness.
Disparities in Healthcare Access:

Focus: Investigate how access to healthcare and patient outcomes differ across racial, income, and insurance status groups.
Techniques: Utilized pivot tables, charts, and advanced filtering to compare treatment success rates and access disparities.
Tools and Techniques:

Excel Tools: Pivot tables, advanced formulas, data cleaning techniques, and visualizations.
Data Visualization: Bar charts, heat maps, and line graphs to highlight trends in costs, admissions, and medical conditions.
Insights:
Found a correlation between specific medical conditions and demographic factors such as age and gender.
Discovered cost discrepancies based on admission type, with emergency admissions being the most costly.
Unearthed healthcare access gaps, particularly for lower-income groups.
